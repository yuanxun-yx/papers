  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>
    Recent progress in artificial intelligence (AI) has primarily come from scaling compute and data, 
    yet it faces architectural limits, and moving toward artificial general intelligence (AGI) requires 
    engagement with the brain's native spike-based neural code. An experimentally testable, code-level 
    <i>in vivo</i> testbed for the neural code is lacking, and the retinal ganglion cell (RGC) layer is 
    among the most durable and biologically viable interfaces within the eye. We reframe the retinal 
    prosthesis as a spike-level experimental interface, generate artificial spike sequences that conform 
    to the RGC neural code without relying on cortical plasticity or <em>code-agnostic machine-learning</em>
    (CA-ML) approaches that do not resolve the underlying neural code, and use these sequences to study 
    rules of the neural code. The objective is neural code fidelity between artificial and biological 
    retinas: for matched visual input, emitted spike sequences should be interpretable by downstream 
    circuits and reproduce the temporal structure of RGC activity above the <em>noise floor</em>. 
    We propose possible implementations of the artificial retina and bioelectronic interface, and outline 
    potential approaches for data and biological validation. This work sets out an experimental pathway 
    for probing the neural code and establishes a research trajectory for studies on AGI and the brain's 
    mechanisms of expression.
